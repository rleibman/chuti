# Chuti Deployment Configuration
# Copy this file to .deploy-config and fill in your server details
# DO NOT commit .deploy-config to version control (it's in .gitignore)

# Server connection details
DEPLOY_SERVER_HOST="your-server.example.com"
DEPLOY_SERVER_USER="your-username"

# Optional: SSH port (default: 22)
# DEPLOY_SERVER_PORT="22"

# Optional: Custom SSH key
# DEPLOY_SSH_KEY="/path/to/your/ssh/key"

# Notes:
# - Ensure SSH key-based authentication is configured
#   Run: ssh-copy-id ${DEPLOY_SERVER_USER}@${DEPLOY_SERVER_HOST}
# - The deployment user MUST have passwordless sudo configured
#   On the server, run: sudo visudo
#   Add line: ${DEPLOY_SERVER_USER} ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/dpkg, /usr/bin/systemctl, /usr/bin/apt-get, /usr/bin/journalctl, /usr/bin/mkdir, /usr/bin/chown, /usr/bin/cp, /usr/bin/rm, /usr/bin/tar, /usr/bin/true
#   Or for full access: ${DEPLOY_SERVER_USER} ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
# - The server should have the following pre-configured:
#   - MariaDB running with chuti database
#   - Environment variables set in /etc/default/chuti-server
#   - Nginx configured for www.chuti.fun:
#     * Static frontend served by nginx
#     * Reverse proxy to backend on port 8079
#   - SSL certificates (use certbot)
#   - systemd service will be installed by the .deb package

# Deployment Architecture:
# - Application frontend: built with sbt dist -> deployed to /data/www/www.chuti.fun/html
# - Application backend: packaged as .deb -> runs as systemd service on port 8079
